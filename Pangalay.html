        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Pangalay is a traditional Mindanaoan folk dance from the Sama-Bajau people 
            of the Sulu Archipelago and southern Mindanao. It is characterized by slow, 
            graceful, and intricate hand and arm movements, often mimicking the movements 
            of birds or sea creatures. The dance emphasizes flexibility, balance, and fluidity, 
            and is usually performed by women, often accompanied by kulintang music 
            or other traditional percussion instruments.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Pangalay is believed to have originated among the Sama-Bajau communities, 
            who traditionally lived in coastal areas and relied on the sea for livelihood. 
            The dance reflects the rhythms and motions of nature, particularly the fluid movements 
            of fish, birds, and waves. Historically, it was performed 
            during weddings, celebrations, and important social gatherings as a form of 
            entertainment and cultural expression.</p>

        <h2>Costume</h2>
        <p>Female dancers wear traditional Sama-Bajau attire, often consisting of 
            long flowing skirts, colorful blouses, and elaborate jewelry. 
            The costume allows flexibility for the arms and hands, highlighting the intricate movements. 
            Male dancers, if present, typically wear traditional Mindanaoan attire that 
            is simpler to allow focus on the female movements.</p>

        <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
        <p>Pangalay represents grace, discipline, and cultural identity of the Sama-Bajau and other 
            Mindanaoan communities. The dance preserves traditional gestures and storytelling through movement, 
            reflecting the close relationship between humans and nature. Today, Pangalay is performed in cultural 
            festivals, school programs, 
            and international events, helping to maintain and promote the rich heritage of Mindanao folk dances.</p>
