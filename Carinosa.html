        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>📝 Cariñosa is a traditional Filipino folk dance from Luzon, particularly associated with the Bicol region. 
            The name cariñosa comes from the Spanish word meaning “affectionate” or “loving.” 
            The dance is known for its graceful, flirtatious movements and is usually performed by a male and 
            female pair, using fans or handkerchiefs as props. 
            It is often danced to slow and elegant music, emphasizing courtship and romance.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Cariñosa developed during the Spanish colonial period and reflects strong Spanish influence in Filipino culture. 
            It was originally a courtship dance, portraying modesty and affection between a man and a woman. The use of fans 
            and handkerchiefs was inspired by Spanish customs, while the movements were adapted to Filipino sensibilities. 
            Over time, Cariñosa became popular in social gatherings, fiestas, and cultural presentations, especially in Luzon.</p>

        <h2>Costume</h2>
        <p>Female dancers traditionally wear the Maria Clara dress, characterized by a long flowing skirt and puffed sleeves, 
            while male dancers wear a barong Tagalog paired with trousers. Props such as fans and handkerchiefs are essential 
            to the dance and are used to express shyness, teasing, and affection. 
            The costumes are usually in soft or pastel colors, matching the gentle nature of the dance.</p>

        <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
        <p>Cariñosa symbolizes Filipino values of modesty, respect, and romantic courtship. 
            The dance highlights elegance, grace, and emotional expression rather than strength or speed. 
            It reflects the blending of Spanish influence with Filipino culture, making it one of the most 
            recognized and cherished folk dances in the Philippines. Today, Cariñosa is commonly performed during cultural events, 
            school programs, and fiestas, representing the romantic and refined side of Filipino tradition.</p>
