        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Pandanggo sa Ilaw is a traditional Filipino folk 
            dance that originated in Mindoro and later spread 
            to other parts of Luzon. The name translates to “dance of lights,” 
            combining the Spanish word fandango, meaning a lively dance, 
            and the Filipino word ilaw, meaning light. The dance involves 
            performers balancing oil lamps or candles on their hands, heads, 
            or on containers while executing graceful and rhythmic movements. 
            It is usually performed to lively rondalla music, highlighting both 
            coordination and poise.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Pandanggo sa Ilaw traces its roots to the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines 
            (16th–19th centuries). It evolved from the Spanish fandango, a courtship dance, 
            which was adapted by Filipinos to include oil lamps, symbolizing light, festivity, 
            and joy. The dance became popular in town fiestas, religious celebrations, and social 
            gatherings, particularly in Mindoro, and eventually spread to other provinces such as 
            Batangas and Cavite. Over time, 
            it developed into a uniquely Filipino form of artistic expression.</p>

        <h2>Costume</h2>
        <p>Female dancers typically wear a Filipiniana dress, 
            a long gown with puffed sleeves, often decorated with 
            lace or embroidery, while male dancers wear the barong 
            Tagalog or traditional Filipino shirts with trousers. 
            Dancers generally perform barefoot or with soft slippers 
            o allow smooth and controlled movements. The lamps or glasses 
            used in the dance may be decorated with ribbons or placed in small 
            containers to help with balance.</p>

        <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
        <p>Pandanggo sa Ilaw highlights grace, skill, and balance, 
            as performers must carefully balance the lamps while dancing. 
            The dance reflects the Filipino ability to adapt foreign influences 
            into local culture, combining Spanish heritage with Filipino creativity. 
            Traditionally, it was performed during fiestas, weddings, and other celebrations, 
            erving as both entertainment and a display of social harmony. Today, it remains one 
            of the most iconic Filipino folk dances, symbolizing joy, festivity, and cultural pride.</p>
