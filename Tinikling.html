        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Tinikling is one of the most well-known traditional Filipino folk dances and originates from the Visayas, 
            particularly Leyte. The dance involves performers skillfully stepping in and out of two bamboo poles that are 
            rhythmically clapped together and against the ground. 
            Tinikling is known for its fast pace, agility, and precise timing, making it both challenging and visually striking.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Tinikling traces its origins to the Spanish colonial period and was inspired by the movement of the 
            tikling bird, which is known for its ability to avoid traps and obstacles. According to tradition, 
            the dance developed from a form of punishment imposed on Filipino laborers, who were forced to work 
            between bamboo poles. Over time, this practice evolved into a dance that celebrated skill, 
            resilience, and creativity. Tinikling eventually became popular in fiestas, community gatherings, and 
            cultural performances.</p>

        <h2>Costume</h2>
        <p>Female dancers traditionally wear a Balintawak dress or patadyong and blouse, while male dancers wear a 
            barong Tagalog or camisa de chino with trousers. The costumes are typically light and flexible, allowing ease 
            of movement during the quick steps. 
            Dancers usually perform barefoot to maintain better control and balance while dancing between the bamboo poles.</p>

        <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
        <p>Tinikling symbolizes Filipino resilience, agility, and harmony with nature. 
            The dance highlights cooperation, as dancers must move in perfect coordination with the 
            pole handlers. Today, Tinikling is recognized as a national symbol of Philippine folk dance 
            and is widely performed in schools, 
            cultural festivals, and international events, representing the energy and spirit of Filipino culture.</p>
