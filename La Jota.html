        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>La Jota is a traditional Filipino folk dance that originated from Spanish influence and is performed in 
            various regions of the Philippines, particularly in Luzon and the Visayas. The dance is characterized by 
            lively footwork, rhythmic stamping, and the use of castanets or hand movements that reflect its 
            European roots. La Jota is commonly performed by couples or groups and is known for its energetic and festive style.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>La Jota was introduced to the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period and was adapted from the 
            Spanish dance of the same name. Filipinos incorporated local movements and musical elements, transforming it into 
            a unique folk dance suited to Philippine culture. Over time, different regions developed their own versions, 
            such as Jota Moncadeña and Jota Manileña, which are often performed during fiestas and religious celebrations.</p>

        <h2>Costume</h2>
        <p>Female dancers typically wear the Maria Clara dress or other traditional Filipina attire, 
            while male dancers wear the barong Tagalog or traditional Filipino shirts with trousers. 
            Accessories such as fans or castanets may be used to emphasize rhythm and movement. 
            The costumes are often elegant and formal, reflecting the dance’s Spanish influence.</p>

        <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
        <p>La Jota represents the blend of Spanish and Filipino cultures, showcasing how foreign influences were 
            adapted into local traditions. The dance highlights grace, rhythm, and coordination, and it remains an 
            important part of Philippine folk dance heritage. Today, La Jota is performed during cultural festivals, 
            school programs, 
            and special occasions, helping preserve the historical and artistic legacy of Filipino folk dances.</p>
