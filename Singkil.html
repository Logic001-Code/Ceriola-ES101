        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Singkil is a traditional Mindanaoan folk dance from the Maranao people of Lanao del Sur in Mindanao. 
            The dance depicts a scene from the epic Darangen, where a princess gracefully navigates through bamboo 
            poles that cross and clap rhythmically, symbolizing obstacles in her path. Singkil is known for its graceful, 
            intricate movements, use of fans and scarves, and the dramatic coordination between dancers and bamboo pole handlers.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Singkil originated among the Maranao royalty and was traditionally performed to entertain members of 
            the sultan’s court. The dance tells the story of Princess Gandingan, who escapes a forest during an earthquake, 
            as told in the Darangen epic. Singkil evolved from a courtly dance into a performance for festivals, 
            cultural shows, and competitions, maintaining its ceremonial and narrative significance.</p>

        <h2>Costume</h2>
        <p>Female dancers wear royal Maranao attire, often including a malong or long flowing dress, 
            intricate embroidery, and golden accessories. Male dancers typically wear traditional Maranao 
            male clothing, such as a camisa de chino, trousers, and headdress, 
            and handle the bamboo poles. Dancers also use fans or scarves to enhance the storytelling and visual appeal.</p>

        <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
        <p>Singkil represents grace, precision, and storytelling in Maranao culture. 
            The dance reflects the Filipino appreciation for narrative and ceremonial 
            radition, combining movement, music, and props to depict a story from an epic. 
            Today, Singkil is considered a cultural treasure of Mindanao and is performed in festivals, 
            schools, and cultural presentations, preserving the heritage of the Maranao people.</p>
