        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Kappa Malong-Malong is a traditional Mindanaoan folk dance from the Maranao and Maguindanao people of 
            Mindanao. The dance highlights the versatility of the malong, a tubular garment, by demonstrating various 
            ways it can be worn—as a skirt, shawl, head covering, or sash—while dancers perform graceful steps. 
            It is usually performed by both men and women, often accompanied by lively percussion or folk music.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The dance originated among the Maranao and Maguindanao communities in Mindanao as a way to 
            showcase the practical and cultural importance of the malong in daily life. Historically, 
            the malong was a multipurpose garment used for clothing, carrying items, and ceremonial purposes. 
            Over time, the dance evolved into a performative folk dance, 
            presented during festivals, weddings, and cultural events to celebrate Mindanaoan heritage.</p>

        <h2>Costume</h2>
        <p>Dancers wear colorful malongs, with designs and patterns often reflecting traditional Maranao or 
            Maguindanao weaving styles. Women may drape the malong as a long skirt, shawl, or head covering, 
            while men wear it as a sarong or sash. 
            The costumes are vibrant and flexible, allowing dancers to move freely while showing the malong’s versatility.</p>

        <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
        <p>Kappa Malong-Malong celebrates the creativity, resourcefulness, and cultural identity of the 
            Mindanaoan people. The dance emphasizes the importance of the malong in daily life and social customs, 
            while also showcasing grace, rhythm, and coordination. Today, it is commonly performed in festivals, 
            cultural presentations, and school programs, preserving the traditions and artistic heritage of Mindanao.</p>
