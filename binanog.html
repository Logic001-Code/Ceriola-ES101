        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Binanog is a traditional Filipino folk dance from Panay Island in the Visayas, 
            particularly associated with Antique and Capiz. The dance imitates the movements of a hawk (banog), 
            such as soaring, gliding, and swooping down to catch its prey. 
            It is commonly performed by a solo dancer or a pair, accompanied by lively folk music.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Binanog originated among the Visayan people and was inspired by the natural behavior of the banog (hawk), 
            which was admired for its strength, agility, and grace. The dance reflects the close relationship between early 
            Filipinos and nature. Traditionally, 
            it was performed during harvest celebrations and community gatherings, symbolizing freedom and bravery.</p>

        <h2>Costume</h2>
        <p>Dancers typically wear traditional Visayan attire. Female dancers often wear a kimona and patadyong, 
            while male dancers wear a camisa de chino and trousers. The costume is usually simple to allow free movement, 
            and some versions include wing-like arm movements or light fabric to emphasize the hawk-like motions of the dance.</p>

        <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
        <p>Binanog represents freedom, strength, and grace, reflecting the admired qualities of 
            the hawk in Filipino culture. The dance highlights the Filipino connection to nature and 
            wildlife, as well as the creativity of Visayan folk traditions. Today, Binanog is performed in 
            cultural festivals and school presentations, 
            helping preserve and promote the rich heritage of the Visayas.</p>
